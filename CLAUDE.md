# Spec-Driven Development (SDD)

This project uses a spec-driven development workflow. Follow these rules in all interactions.

## Core Principle

**Spec before code.** Define behavior before implementing it.

```
┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐
│   DESIGN    │ ──▶ │    SPEC     │ ──▶ │    TEST     │ ──▶ │ IMPLEMENT   │
│ (tokens +   │     │ (Gherkin +  │     │  (failing)  │     │ (loop until │
│  stubs)     │     │  mockup)    │     │             │     │ tests pass) │
└─────────────┘     └─────────────┘     └─────────────┘     └─────────────┘
```

## When Implementing Features

### For New Features
1. Check if spec exists in `.specs/features/`
2. If not, create one with Gherkin scenarios + ASCII mockup
3. Reference design tokens in mockups
4. Create component stubs for new UI components
5. **STOP for approval** before writing tests
6. Write failing tests
7. Implement until tests pass
8. Fill in component documentation

### For Existing Features
1. Read the feature spec first
2. Update spec if behavior changes
3. Update tests to match
4. Update `.specs/mapping.md`

### For Bug Fixes
1. Check if spec defines expected behavior
2. If gap found, add scenario to spec
3. Write failing test that reproduces bug
4. Fix the bug
5. Document the new test

---

## Pause Triggers

If the user says any of these, create the spec and **STOP** - wait for approval:
- "let me review first"
- "write the spec first"
- "spec this out"
- "don't implement yet"
- "plan this first"
- "hold on" / "wait"

After showing spec: "Does this look right? Ready to write tests?"
After tests written: "Tests written (failing). Ready to implement?"

---

## Feature Spec Format

Every feature spec should include:

```markdown
# Feature Name

**Source File**: path/to/file.tsx
**Design System**: .specs/design-system/tokens.md

## Feature: [Name]

### Scenario: [Happy path]
Given [precondition]
When [action]
Then [expected result]

### Scenario: [Edge case]
...

## UI Mockup

(ASCII art showing component layout)

## Component References

- Button: .specs/design-system/components/button.md
```

---

## Design System

This project uses design tokens defined in `.specs/design-system/tokens.md`.

### Token Reference

When implementing UI, use these token names (not hardcoded values):

**Colors:**
- `color-primary`, `color-secondary` - Brand colors
- `color-background`, `color-surface` - Backgrounds
- `color-text`, `color-text-secondary` - Text
- `color-error`, `color-success`, `color-warning` - Semantic

**Typography:**
- `text-xs` through `text-5xl` - Font sizes
- `font-normal`, `font-medium`, `font-semibold`, `font-bold` - Weights

**Spacing:**
- `spacing-1` through `spacing-16` - Spacing scale

**Border Radius:**
- `radius-sm`, `radius-md`, `radius-lg`, `radius-xl`, `radius-full`

**Shadows:**
- `shadow-sm`, `shadow-md`, `shadow-lg`, `shadow-xl`

### Design System Maintenance

The token summary above should stay in sync with `.specs/design-system/tokens.md`.

When design tokens change:
1. Update `.specs/design-system/tokens.md` (source of truth)
2. Update the token summary in this CLAUDE.md file
3. Update any affected component documentation

When new components are created:
1. Create stub in `.specs/design-system/components/`
2. After implementation, fill in with `/design-component`

---

## Component Stub Lifecycle

```
1. /spec-first "user profile"
   └─▶ Mockup references "Card" component
   └─▶ Card doesn't exist → CREATE STUB

2. Stub created: .specs/design-system/components/card.md
   Status: 📝 Stub (pending implementation)

3. Implementation happens...

4. /design-component card
   └─▶ Reads actual component code
   └─▶ Fills in props, variants, usage examples
   └─▶ Status: ✅ Documented
```

## Always Mention

When working with specs, always tell the user:
- Which spec files you're reading/creating/updating
- Which design system files you're referencing
- Any gaps between specs and tests
- Component stubs that need documentation

---

## File Locations

| Type | Location |
|------|----------|
| App vision | `.specs/vision.md` |
| Build roadmap | `.specs/roadmap.md` |
| Feature specs | `.specs/features/{domain}/{feature}.feature.md` |
| Test suite docs | `.specs/test-suites/{mirrors test dir}` |
| Design tokens | `.specs/design-system/tokens.md` |
| Component docs | `.specs/design-system/components/{name}.md` |
| Mapping | `.specs/mapping.md` (auto-generated) |
| Cross-cutting learnings | `.specs/learnings/` (by category) |

---

## Mapping File

The `.specs/mapping.md` file is **auto-generated** from feature spec YAML frontmatter.

**Do not edit mapping.md directly.** Instead:
1. Update the feature spec's YAML frontmatter
2. The Cursor hook will regenerate mapping.md automatically
3. Or run `./scripts/generate-mapping.sh` manually

### Feature Spec Frontmatter

Every feature spec should have YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
feature: Feature Name
domain: domain-name
source: path/to/source.tsx
tests:
  - path/to/test.ts
components:
  - ComponentName
status: stub | specced | tested | implemented
created: YYYY-MM-DD
updated: YYYY-MM-DD
---
```

---

## Learnings

Cross-cutting learnings are stored in `.specs/learnings/` by category:

| Category | File |
|----------|------|
| Testing | `.specs/learnings/testing.md` |
| Performance | `.specs/learnings/performance.md` |
| Security | `.specs/learnings/security.md` |
| API & Data | `.specs/learnings/api.md` |
| Design System | `.specs/learnings/design.md` |
| General | `.specs/learnings/general.md` |

Read `.specs/learnings/index.md` for a summary and recent learnings.

Feature-specific learnings are in each spec's `## Learnings` section.

Run `/compound` at the end of implementation sessions to extract and persist learnings.

---

## Roadmap System

For building entire apps, use the roadmap system:

### vision.md

High-level app description:
- What the app does
- Target users
- Key screens
- Tech stack

Created by `/clone-app <url>`.

### roadmap.md

Ordered list of features with dependencies and status:

```markdown
| # | Feature | Source | Jira | Complexity | Deps | Status |
|---|---------|--------|------|------------|------|--------|
| 1 | Auth: Signup | clone-app | PROJ-101 | M | - | ✅ |
| 2 | Dashboard | clone-app | PROJ-102 | L | 1 | ⬜ |
```

Status symbols:
- ⬜ Pending
- 🔄 In Progress
- ✅ Completed
- ⏸️ Blocked
- ❌ Cancelled

### Building from Roadmap

1. `/clone-app` creates vision.md + roadmap.md
2. `/build-next` picks next pending feature (deps met)
3. Runs `/spec-first --full` to build it
4. Updates roadmap status
5. Repeat until done

### Triage

`/roadmap-triage` scans Slack/Jira and adds items to the "Ad-hoc Requests" section of roadmap.md.
