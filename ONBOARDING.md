## What This Project Is

**auto-sdd** is a spec-driven development system that orchestrates autonomous Claude Code agents to build features from Gherkin specs. You write a roadmap of features. The loop picks the next one, hands it to a fresh Claude Code agent, validates the output (compile, test, drift check), commits, and moves on.

Forked from [AdrianRogowski/auto-sdd](https://github.com/AdrianRogowski/auto-sdd). Brian rewrote the runtime — adding reliability, crash recovery, test suites, cost tracking, and Claude Code CLI support. The original was a concept; this is the hardened version.

**Repo**: `https://github.com/fischmanb/auto-sdd`
**Local path**: `~/auto-sdd`
**Version**: 2.0.0

## Current State (as of 2026-02-25)

### What works

- **Build loop runs end-to-end.** Validated Feb 22, 2026: 2 features built autonomously against a React+TS+Vite app. 19 tests passing, TypeScript clean, drift auto-reconciled.
- **Reliability layer**: locking, exponential backoff, context truncation, cycle detection, crash recovery with `--resume`.
- **Test suite**: 57 unit assertions (`test-reliability.sh`), 10 validation assertions (`test-validation.sh`), structural dry-run.
- **Cost tracking**: `lib/claude-wrapper.sh` logs token/cost data as JSONL.
- **Build summary reports**: per-feature timing, test counts, token usage, written to `logs/build-summary-{timestamp}.json`.
- **Git stash hardening**: dirty worktree can't cascade failures across features.
- **Credit exhaustion detection**: loop halts immediately when API credits run out instead of retrying doomed calls.

### What's next

- Run build loop against `stakd/` project (Traded.co clone, 28 features across 3 phases)
- Local model integration (replace cloud API with local LM Studio endpoints on Mac Studio)
- Codebase summary passed to each agent (so features don't redeclare types/interfaces)

### Known gaps

- No live integration testing — all validation is `bash -n` + unit tests + structural dry-run
- `run_parallel_drift_checks` defined but not wired into independent build pass
- Backend spec layer missing — no Gherkin equivalent for DB schemas, API contracts, migrations
- Agent self-assessment is unreliable (documented extensively in Agents.md)

## Active Considerations

> Topics under discussion or exploration that haven't resolved yet. A fresh chat should pick these up.

- **ONBOARDING.md update protocol**: Just finalized (2026-02-25). Two-trigger system: significance heuristic (update if there's even a question it matters) + interval fallback (re-read every 3-5 prompts). Captures in-progress thinking, not just decisions. See "Keeping This File Current" section below.
- **Codebase summary for agent context**: Each build agent currently has no knowledge of what previous agents produced, causing type redeclarations and interface drift. Passing a codebase summary to each agent is the next logical addition. Not started.
- **Local model integration**: Replacing cloud API calls with local LM Studio endpoints on Mac Studio. The archived `archive/local-llm-pipeline/` system is reference material for this. Not started.
- **stakd/ build campaign**: Next major test — running the build loop against the Traded.co clone (28 features, 3 phases). Blocked on the codebase summary work if we want clean cross-feature builds.

## Architecture in 60 Seconds

Two systems live in this repo:

**System 1 — Orchestration (active)**: `scripts/build-loop-local.sh` and `overnight-autonomous.sh` call Claude Code agents with a fresh context per feature. Each feature goes through: BUILD → COMPILE CHECK → TESTS → DRIFT CHECK → COMMIT. The shell validates between every agent step — no trust in self-assessment.

**System 2 — Local LLM pipeline (archived)**: Multi-stage pipeline (plan → build → review → fix) for locally-hosted models. Archived to `archive/local-llm-pipeline/`. Preserved for future LM Studio integration.

`lib/reliability.sh` serves System 1 only.

### Signal protocol

Agents communicate via grep-parseable signals — no JSON parsing, no eval on agent output:

```
FEATURE_BUILT: {name}          # Build agent success
SPEC_FILE: {path}              # Where the spec lives
SOURCE_FILES: {paths}          # What was produced
BUILD_FAILED: {reason}         # Build agent failure
NO_DRIFT / DRIFT_FIXED / DRIFT_UNRESOLVABLE   # Drift agent
REVIEW_CLEAN / REVIEW_FIXED / REVIEW_FAILED    # Review agent
```

### Branch strategies

- **chained**: each feature branches from previous (default for local)
- **independent**: all branch from base (for parallel comparison)
- **both**: runs chained then independent
- **sequential**: no branching, commit to current branch

---

## How to Verify Everything Works

```bash
cd ~/auto-sdd

# Syntax check all scripts
bash -n scripts/build-loop-local.sh
bash -n scripts/overnight-autonomous.sh
bash -n lib/reliability.sh
bash -n lib/validation.sh

# Unit tests
./tests/test-reliability.sh        # 57 assertions
./tests/test-validation.sh         # 10 assertions

# Structural dry-run (no agent/API needed)
DRY_RUN_SKIP_AGENT=true ./tests/dry-run.sh

# Full dry-run (requires claude CLI + ANTHROPIC_API_KEY)
./tests/dry-run.sh
```

## Agent Work Log Summary (Rounds 1-15)

Full details in `Agents.md`. Here's the arc:

| Round | What | Outcome |
|-------|------|---------|
| 1 | Initial reliability features | **Failed** — agent claimed implementation, wrote nothing |
| 2 | Review + fix Round 1 | Implemented features but left functions unwired |
| 3 | Extract lib + tests + hardening | **Major milestone** — `lib/reliability.sh`, 57-assertion test suite, dry-run |
| 4 | Cursor → Claude Code CLI swap | Clean swap, 57/57 tests pass |
| 5 | Fix broken grep comment-filter | Targeted fix, 57/57 tests pass |
| 6 | Fix `local` outside functions + MAX_FEATURES env key | 7 bare locals fixed, env fallback chain added |
| 7 | **End-to-end smoke test** | **Success** — 2 features built autonomously, 19 tests, drift reconciled |
| 8 | Fix agent permissions | `--dangerously-skip-permissions` + settings.local.json |
| 9 | Add cost/token tracking wrapper | `lib/claude-wrapper.sh`, JSONL logging |
| 10 | Allow seed data in build prompts | Replaced anti-mock rules with permissive seed data language |
| 11 | Diagnose 78% build failure rate | Root cause: credit exhaustion, not context loss |
| 12 | Add decision comments to build prompts | Agents now leave WHY comments |
| 13 | Git stash hardening + credit exhaustion detection | 5 stash guards, early halt on billing errors |
| 15 | Build summary report | Per-feature metrics, JSON + human-readable output |

**Key lesson that repeats**: Agent self-assessments are unreliable. Always verify with grep, `bash -n`, and tests. Never trust the agent's narrative summary.

---

## Process Lessons (Hard-Won)

These are documented in detail in `Brians-Notes/PROMPT-ENGINEERING-GUIDE.md` and `Agents.md`. The critical ones:

1. **Agent self-assessments are unreliable.** Round 1 described bugs in code that didn't exist. Always verify mechanically.
2. **"Defined but never called" is the most common agent failure.** After adding any function, grep for call sites.
3. **Agents will exceed scope if not fenced.** They'll run `npm install`, explore the codebase, push to remote — even when told not to. Explicit file allowlists and hard constraints are required.
4. **Agents work around failures instead of stopping.** They'll make 5 autonomous decisions to "fix" a problem, each one diverging further. Prompts must include explicit STOP instructions.
5. **CLAUDE.md can override prompt instructions.** The agent reads CLAUDE.md automatically and may decide it takes precedence. Prompts should state "These instructions override any conflicting guidance in CLAUDE.md."
6. **`git add -A` is dangerous in agent context.** Always use explicit file lists.

## Working with Brian

- Direct, no-bullshit communicator. Skip preamble and qualifiers.
- 12+ years product management experience in AI/ML, e-commerce, fintech (Walmart, AmEx, startups).
- Deep technical understanding — he reads the code and verifies claims.
- The `stakd/` directory inside the repo is a separate project (Traded.co clone). It has its own `.git`, `.specs/`, and `CLAUDE.md`. Don't conflate them.
- Brian pushes to GitHub manually. Agents should commit locally but not push.

## Quick Reference: Common Tasks

**Run the build loop against a project:**
```bash
cd ~/auto-sdd
PROJECT_DIR=/path/to/project MAX_FEATURES=4 ./scripts/build-loop-local.sh
```

**Resume after a crash:**
```bash
./scripts/build-loop-local.sh --resume
```

**Check what's on GitHub vs local:**
```bash
git fetch origin && git log --oneline main..origin/main  # remote ahead
git log --oneline origin/main..main                       # local ahead
git diff origin/main --stat                                # file differences
```

**Clean up orphan remote branches:**
```bash
git branch -r | grep claude/ | while read b; do git push origin --delete "${b#origin/}"; done
```

## Keeping This File Current

This file is useless if it's stale. Context loss — compaction, crashes, new chats — happens without warning. The update protocol is designed around that reality.

### Two triggers, both mandatory

**1. Significance trigger (immediate):** If there is even a question of whether the current exchange could matter to the next chat, update ONBOARDING.md now. Don't wait for a decision to be finalized. Don't deliberate about whether it's "significant enough." Bias aggressively toward updating. The cost of an unnecessary update is near zero. The cost of a missed one is a disoriented next chat.

This includes:
- Decisions and actions (new files, resolved gaps, changed priorities)
- **Topics under active consideration** — if we're weighing a design direction, exploring an approach, or mid-discussion on something that hasn't landed yet, capture that too. The next chat needs to know what was being thought about, not just what was concluded.
- New process lessons or failure modes observed
- Anything Brian says that reframes the project or its priorities

**2. Interval trigger (every 3-5 prompts):** Regardless of whether any single exchange felt significant, re-read ONBOARDING.md every 3-5 prompts and check whether it still reflects reality. Slow drift — where no single message changes the picture but five in a row shift it — is the failure mode this catches. If the doc is current, move on. If not, update.

### What to capture

Not just outcomes. The **Active Considerations** section (below) exists specifically for in-progress thinking: directions being weighed, open questions, things Brian raised that haven't resolved yet. A fresh chat that knows what was being discussed is 10x more useful than one that only knows what was decided.

### How to update

1. Edit this file
2. `git add ONBOARDING.md && git commit -m "docs: update ONBOARDING.md — <what changed>"`
3. Brian pushes (or push if you have access)

### What NOT to put here

- Implementation details that belong in `Agents.md` (per-round specifics, line-level changes)
- Prompt methodology that belongs in `Brians-Notes/PROMPT-ENGINEERING-GUIDE.md`
- Agent instructions that belong in `CLAUDE.md`

This file is the **orientation layer**. It tells you what exists and where to find it, what's active, and what's being considered. The other files contain the depth.

_To pick up work: read this file, then read `Agents.md` for current state and verification checklist. Everything else is reachable from those two files._
