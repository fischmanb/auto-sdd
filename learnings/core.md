# Core Learnings

> Curated subset of the learnings catalog. Read on every fresh onboard. Self-contained — each entry is a full duplicate from its type file, not a pointer.
>
> Curation: chat-proposed (📌 core candidate), Brian-approved.
> Schema: see `DESIGN-PRINCIPLES.md` §3 (edge types) and §4 (confidence/status enums).
> ID range: global sequential `L-XXXX` shared across all learnings files.
