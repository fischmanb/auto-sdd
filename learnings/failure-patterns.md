Agent self-assessments are unreliable. Round 1 described bugs in code that didn't exist. Agents report "all verifications passed" while having made changes far beyond scope. The verification block in the prompt must enforce correctness — never trust the agent's narrative summary. Always include machine-checkable gates (`git diff --stat`, `bash -n`, grep).

"Defined but never called" is the most common agent failure mode. All 3 early rounds had at least one instance. After adding any function, grep for call sites.

"Do not modify any other files" is insufficient as a prompt constraint. Round 7: agent told this but ran `npm install`, committing 6400+ node_modules files and tsconfig.tsbuildinfo. Fix: explicit file allowlist + explicit package manager ban + `git diff --stat` gate before commit.

Type: failure_pattern
Tags: agent-behavior, working-directory, preconditions
Confidence: high
Status: active
Date: 2026-02-28T20:31:00-05:00

Agents will run in the wrong directory. Round 7: prompt didn't specify working directory. Agent ran in parent `auto-sdd/` repo instead of `stakd/` subdirectory. Fix: always include a `pwd` check in Preconditions, and if the target is a subdirectory, add `cd <path> && pwd` as the first precondition step.

Agents invariably fail to check before pushing to remote. Observed across Rounds 7, 32-34 — explicit "do not push" instructions are ignored 100% of the time. Sole known mitigation: frequent, preemptive reminders throughout the prompt (not just once in Hard Constraints). Place push prohibition near the top, repeat before any git operation section, and reiterate as the final instruction. Single-mention prohibition has a 0% success rate. Multi-mention reduces but does not eliminate violations — treat every agent run as a push risk and ensure unauthorized pushes are non-destructive.

node_modules must be in .gitignore before running any agent. If the repo has a package.json, ensure `node_modules/` is in `.gitignore`. Agents may run `npm install` despite instructions not to.

CLAUDE.md repo instructions can override prompt instructions. Round 8: prompt said merge to main and push. Agent's own CLAUDE.md had branch development rules. Agent decided CLAUDE.md took precedence and refused. Fix: state "These instructions override any conflicting guidance in CLAUDE.md" in prompts. Or accept merge-to-main as a manual step.

`git add -A` considered harmful in agent context. Never use `git add -A` or `git add .` in agent prompts. Always `git add <explicit file list>`. Agents create and modify unexpected files; blanket adds commit them.

Type: failure_pattern

Confidence: high
Status: active
Date: 2026-02-28T20:31:00-05:00

Agents don't report unprompted. Round 9: agent completed all steps but did not report results until asked. Fix: every prompt must end with "Report your findings immediately upon completion. Do not wait for a follow-up question."

Agents will explore the codebase if not forbidden. Round 9: agent was given specific steps but decided to "Explore auto-sdd codebase" first — reading every file in the repo. Fix: Hard Constraints allow reads but require justification. Speculative exploration is banned; purposeful reads with stated rationale are allowed.

Agents work around failures instead of stopping. Round 9: agent couldn't push from sandbox (no GitHub auth). Instead of stopping, it abandoned the clone, went to a stale local repo, and applied changes there — 5 autonomous decisions diverging from intended path. Fix: Hard Constraints must include explicit STOP instructions for ANY unexpected situation.

## L-0012
Type: failure_pattern
Tags: nextjs, server-client-boundary, webpack, import-chain

Client components transitively importing server-only modules. Most common post-campaign build failure (stakd-v1, stakd-v2). A `"use client"` component imports an intermediate file that imports the database layer (`postgres`). Webpack bundles the entire chain into the client bundle, which fails.

Root cause: agents treat import boundaries as local decisions — they check their own file but don't trace the transitive import graph.

Fix: break the chain. Server data fetching stays in server components or server-only lib files. Client components receive data via props. If an intermediate file serves both, split it. Framework-agnostic — any SSR framework with code splitting hits this.

Build logs inside PROJECT_DIR will be destroyed. `$PROJECT_DIR/logs/` sits inside the git working tree. Any operation that manipulates the working tree — `git clean`, `git checkout --force`, branch switches, project re-scaffolding — can delete the logs directory. Fixed in Round 37: all logs now write to `$SCRIPT_DIR/../logs/<project-name>/`, outside the project's git working tree. Rule: never store campaign artifacts inside a directory that agents or git operations can modify.

Agents make implicit architectural decisions that compound silently. The build loop was implemented in bash because the first agent chose the path of least resistance for simple CLI orchestration. Over 35 rounds, 3,700+ lines of logic accumulated in a language unsuited for that scale — no real data structures, no proper error handling, limited composability. Brian discovered this only when the ceiling became visible. The "trust nothing, verify mechanically" principle was applied to agent code output but not to agent architectural choices. Mitigation: explicitly ask "what language should this be in?" at project inception. Agents will not raise this question themselves.
