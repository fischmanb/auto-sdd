Independent verification catches what self-assessment misses. Same principle as drift detection (Layer 1 self-check vs Layer 2 cross-check). The build loop validates between every agent step because no single agent's claim about its own work is trustworthy.

Signal protocol uses grep-parseable signals, not JSON. Agents communicate via flat strings (`FEATURE_BUILT: {name}`, `BUILD_FAILED: {reason}`). No JSON parsing, no eval on agent output. Grep is reliable, available everywhere, and fails visibly. JSON parsing introduces fragility — malformed output from an agent silently breaks downstream logic instead of failing at the grep step.

- **Type:** architecture_finding
- **Tags:** bash-to-python, claude-wrapper, invocation-pattern
- **Confidence:** high
- **Date:** 2026-02-28T21:30:00-05:00
- **Source:** Dependency analysis during Phase 0
- **Body:** claude-wrapper.sh is invoked as an external command (`bash lib/claude-wrapper.sh -p ...`), never `source`d. All four consumers (build-loop-local, overnight-autonomous, eval-sidecar, nightly-review) call it the same way. The Python equivalent should be a callable function (`run_claude(prompt, **kwargs) → ClaudeResult`), not a module whose internals get imported. This distinction matters for the interface stub design — wrapper is a service boundary, not a utility library.

"Do not push" conflicts with ephemeral sandbox. Agent prompts said "Do NOT push" per PROMPT-ENGINEERING-GUIDE local-execution pattern. But Claude Code agents run in ephemeral sandboxes — work is lost if not pushed. CLAUDE.md's default push behavior accidentally saved all 5 branches. Resolution: agent prompts for Claude Code MUST include push as final step. Local-only execution pattern only applies when agents run on the actual local machine.

Meta-process patterns transferable to build loop. The bash→Python conversion process surfaced 6 patterns the build loop doesn't implement: (1) code-level dependency analysis before execution order — build loop uses spec-declared deps but not actual import-level edges, (2) context budget estimation before agent dispatch — build loop fires without checking if prompt + summary + spec + headroom fits the effective window, (3) conventions doc injection so agents write consistent code — build loop gives codebase summary (what exists) but not conventions (how to write), which is why type redeclarations happen, (4) interface stubs as pre-declared contracts in specs — agents get descriptions not target signatures, (5) mechanical prompt quality gate before dispatch — build loop generates and dispatches immediately with no intermediate check, (6) cross-feature failure pattern feedback mid-campaign — if feature 5 fails the same way feature 3 did, the build loop doesn't notice or adapt. Items 2/3/5 are highest leverage and directly address documented failure modes. Design input for Phase 4 build-loop conversion.

HOW-I-WORK-WITH-GENERATIVE-AI.md methodology signals are leading indicators of protocol gaps. The evidence that checkpoint step 4 was broken sat in methodology signals for an indeterminate number of responses: "under-capture is a failure mode," "checkpoint should be thorough not mechanical," "Brian expects capture density to match session density." These were captured as raw observations (step 5) but never fed back into protocol review (step 4) or learnings. The methodology signals file is a pre-learnings staging area — observations accumulate there before they're synthesized into actionable rules. A periodic review of methodology signals for patterns that should become learnings or protocol changes would close this feedback loop.

New meta-process infrastructure must scan existing project assets for reusable patterns before building from scratch. The checkpoint/learnings system was built in isolation from the slash command library. Four commands already embodied patterns the system needed: `/catch-drift` (source-of-truth vs claims comparison), `/check-coverage` (gap analysis), `/update-test-docs` (sync docs with reality), `/verify-test-counts` (mechanical count reconciliation). Only the last one was connected — and only after Brian pointed it out. Meanwhile, CLAUDE.md (the conventions file all agents read) still pointed to `.specs/learnings/` (old system) while the new system lives in `learnings/`. `/compound` still writes to the old location. Any agent following CLAUDE.md would write learnings to the wrong place. The pattern: when building process infrastructure, first audit existing commands and conventions files for (1) reusable patterns, (2) stale references the new system invalidates, (3) existing tooling that can be wired in mechanically.

Auto-sdd's build system must remain repo-agnostic. Checkpoint tooling, learnings management, and meta-process commands (like `/verify-learnings-counts`) are auto-sdd's own development infrastructure — they exist to help develop auto-sdd itself. The build loop that auto-sdd runs to build other projects must not depend on or assume these files exist in the target repo. Mechanical integrations into the checkpoint protocol are safe (they run in auto-sdd's context). Mechanical integrations into the build loop are not (they would impose auto-sdd's structure on target repos).
