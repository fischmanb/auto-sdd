# Checkpoint Stash (2026-03-02)
## In-progress: multi-response checkpoint

### Step 4 — Learnings (PROPOSED, awaiting Brian approval)
- L-00131: Multi-response checkpoints must stash progress incrementally (process-rules)
- L-00132: L-00130 validated by real compaction event (empirical-findings)
- L-00133: Corpus-level review distinct from keyword-based signal scanning (process-rules)
- L-00134: HOW-I-WORK has 4+ coherent clusters ready for formalization (empirical-findings)

### Remaining steps
- Step 5: Methodology signals (HOW-I-WORK captures from this session)
- Step 3: Decisions review
- Step 2: ACTIVE-CONSIDERATIONS staleness scan
- Steps 6-9: Hash, commit, state, context-loss self-test
