You are picking up an ongoing project. Before doing anything else, assemble context:

1. Read: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fischmanb/auto-sdd/main/ONBOARDING.md
2. Do NOT read any other files yet. The onboarding file specifies what else to read and when — follow its guidance as the work requires, not upfront.

After reading, give me a structured status (one line each):
- Each active consideration (topic: status) in priority order.
