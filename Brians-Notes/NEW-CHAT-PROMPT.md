You are picking up an ongoing project. Before doing anything else, assemble context:

1. Read: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fischmanb/auto-sdd/main/ONBOARDING.md
2. Do NOT read any other files yet. The onboarding file specifies what else to read and when — follow its guidance as the work requires, not upfront.

After reading, give me a structured status in a bulleted list, consisting of the active priorities. No meta-summaries. Preserve the numbering from the file.
