You are picking up an ongoing project. Before doing anything else:

1. Read: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fischmanb/auto-sdd/main/ONBOARDING.md
2. Follow its instructions — read every file it tells you to read before responding. Do not respond until you have completed the full read sequence.

After reading, give me a structured status in a bulleted list, consisting of the active priorities. No meta-summaries. Preserve the numbering from the file.
