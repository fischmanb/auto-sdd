## Overview

<!-- One paragraph describing the app's purpose -->

**Target users**: <!-- Who is this for? -->

**Core value proposition**: <!-- What problem does it solve? -->

---

## Key Screens / Areas

<!-- List the main areas of the app discovered during /clone-app or planned -->

| Screen | Purpose | Priority |
|--------|---------|----------|
| <!-- e.g., Dashboard --> | <!-- What users do here --> | <!-- Core/Secondary --> |

---

## Tech Stack

<!-- Detected or chosen technology stack -->

## Out of Scope (for now)

<!-- Features explicitly NOT being built in this phase -->

- <!-- e.g., Mobile native apps -->
- <!-- e.g., Multi-tenancy -->

## Reference

<!-- If cloning an existing app -->

**Source app**: <!-- URL or name -->
**Analysis date**: <!-- When /clone-app was run -->
