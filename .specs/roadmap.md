# Build Roadmap

> Ordered list of features to implement. Each feature should be completable within a single agent context window.
> Updated by `/clone-app`, `/roadmap-triage`, and `/build-next`.

## Implementation Rules

**Every feature in this roadmap must be implemented with real data, real API calls, and real database operations.** No exceptions.

- **No mock data** — never use hardcoded arrays, fake JSON, or placeholder content to simulate functionality. If a feature needs data, it reads from the database or calls a real API.
- **No fake API endpoints** — every endpoint must do real work. No routes that return static JSON.
- **No placeholder UI** — components must be wired to real data sources. If the data isn't available yet, show a proper empty state, not fake data.
- **No "demo mode"** — features either work end-to-end or they aren't done. A feature is only ✅ when a real user can use it with their real data.
- **Real validation** — forms validate against real constraints, not just "is this field filled in?"
- **Real error handling** — API failures, empty results, rate limits, and edge cases must be handled, not ignored.
- **Test against real flows** — when verifying a feature, use the app as a user would. Trigger real API calls, see real results.

## Phase 1: Foundation

> Core infrastructure and authentication. Must be built first.

| # | Feature | Source | Jira | Complexity | Deps | Status |
|---|---------|--------|------|------------|------|--------|
| <!-- 1 --> | <!-- Auth: User signup --> | <!-- clone-app --> | <!-- PROJ-101 --> | <!-- M --> | <!-- - --> | <!-- ⬜ --> |

---

## Phase 2: Core Features

> Primary user-facing functionality.

| # | Feature | Source | Jira | Complexity | Deps | Status |
|---|---------|--------|------|------------|------|--------|
| <!-- 10 --> | <!-- Dashboard --> | <!-- clone-app --> | <!-- PROJ-110 --> | <!-- L --> | <!-- 1,2 --> | <!-- ⬜ --> |

---

## Phase 3: Enhancement

> Secondary features, polish, and optimizations.

| # | Feature | Source | Jira | Complexity | Deps | Status |
|---|---------|--------|------|------------|------|--------|
| <!-- 20 --> | <!-- Dark mode --> | <!-- slack:C123/ts --> | <!-- PROJ-120 --> | <!-- S --> | <!-- - --> | <!-- ⬜ --> |

## Ad-hoc Requests

> Features added from Slack/Jira that don't fit a phase. Processed after current phase.

| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| ⬜ | Pending - not started |
| 🔄 | In Progress - currently being built |
| ✅ | Completed - PR merged |
| ⏸️ | Blocked - waiting on dependency or decision |
| ❌ | Cancelled - no longer needed |

## Complexity Legend

| Symbol | Meaning | Typical Scope |
