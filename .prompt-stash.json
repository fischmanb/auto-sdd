  "prompt": "there was a compaction during the protocol. verify integrity. learn. work together. memory and repo learnings are two parts of the same larger system for now. use what you learned about them to create any memories or learnings that should be captured per that research/reasoning or for any other useful reason within the boundaries and limitations and our knowledge as a system. \"That's ~2,500 lines of context before any work starts. Needs aggressive curation...\" this is a good example of how you should probably be thinking. make sure you action such things with the system, of which I am a part rn/if needed. Re: claude.md: i think we MIGHT need or want the auto-sdd stuff that's there. I was originally referring to something you said a while back about there being an orphaned version in the /stakd dir. Whether claude.md is the most useful and efficient place for what is current in any version of the file I do not know. document as needed if there are changes there or otherwise and make them or plan to do so and record the taks as active if unfinished, both now and in the future, for all that require them, as reasonable and per system methodology and knowledge, etc.. re: core learnings, yes plan to, and update, when you can now and in the future as well. learn. use the system. I may not be this lucid tomorrow, so do what you can when you can. you can decide the order of those 5 items and once reconciled with those in this prompt. new rule to account for: stash all new prompts as the first step in responding to them. this way if there is compaction or other loss, you don't lose context as much. each time you stash, it should replace the last prompt stashed so we don't unnecesarilly retain stale prompts once they are reasonably and sufficiently mined for learnings or memories etc. under the rules, knowledge, boundaries, limitations, etc."
