# Session Handoff — 2026-03-01

## Session Summary
Full-day process session: built learnings graph-schema system (62 entries L-0042–L-0103), established dual-storage strategy (memory triggers, repo specifies), audited all persistence systems, created handoff + retiring-chat protocols. Pure process/meta work — no feature code. Two response truncations from overscoping (L-0098, L-0103).

## Commits This Session
- 788f8a8 through 3490cf5: learnings, checkpoint, ONBOARDING expansion
- c5774d1: L-0092–L-0097 (UNPUSHED)
- e58ed8c: L-0098–L-0100, handoff protocol (UNPUSHED)
- [pending]: L-0101–L-0103, handoff update

## Incomplete Work (PRIORITY ORDER)
1. ~~**core.md creation**~~ — ✅ DONE. 16 curated entries, 52 lines. `.specs/learnings/core.md`
2. **CLAUDE.md strip** — 468 → ~100-150 lines. Audit done (L-0094). Remove SDD scaffold, keep governance.
3. **ACTIVE-CONSIDERATIONS.md** — mostly current, core.md item can be marked done
4. **ONBOARDING.md stale refs** — references file structure that doesn't exist (failure-patterns.md etc.)
5. **Old-format conversion** — ~47 entries, prompts ready, Mac Studio candidate.
6. **index.md update** — last updated Feb 26, 62 entries behind.

## Context the Next Session Needs
- Memory and repo are ONE system: memory triggers (always-injected), repo specifies (on-demand). L-0097.
- agent-operations.md is ~780+ lines with 62 entries. HOSTILE to onboard reading without core.md.
- Prompt stash protocol active (memory #15). First action every response.
- Response scope discipline: count work items BEFORE first tool call. >3 items = split. L-0098/L-0103.
- CLAUDE.md root is correct location. stakd/ versions have battle-tested Next.js patterns.
- Brian's methodology: "lucidity windows" — when he's in process mode, maximize capture density.

## Files Modified This Session
- .specs/learnings/agent-operations.md (primary — 62 new entries)
- .specs/HANDOFF-PROTOCOL.md (new)
- ONBOARDING.md, DECISIONS.md, HOW-I-WORK-WITH-GENERATIVE-AI.md, Agents.md
- .onboarding-state, .prompt-stash.json, .handoff.md
