# Session Handoff — 2026-03-01

## Session Summary
Full-day process session: built learnings graph-schema system (61 entries L-0042–L-0102), established dual-storage strategy (memory triggers, repo specifies), audited all persistence systems, created handoff protocol. Pure process/meta work — no feature code.

## Commits This Session
- 788f8a8: ONBOARDING.md checkpoint expansion (Prompt 6)
- a167773: L-0042–L-0056, graph schema entries
- b79e578: L-0057–L-0060
- cfe018a: L-0061–L-0065
- ab59d3e: L-0067–L-0069, false-premise interval fix
- 896dd23: L-0070/71, checkpoint semantics
- 71754fb: L-0072–L-0080, full session mining
- e998abd: L-0081–L-0085, system audit
- 3490cf5: Checkpoint — L-0086–L-0091, Round 40
- c5774d1: L-0092–L-0097 (prompt stash, compaction, CLAUDE.md, memory, unified system, lucidity)
- e58ed8c: L-0098–L-0100 (handoff protocol, scope discipline, truncation defense)
- 5f7df69: L-0101–L-0102 (handoff scope correction, compound returns)
- [this checkpoint]: final checkpoint commit

## Incomplete Work
1. **core.md creation**: ONBOARDING.md references it but file doesn't exist. Curated ~15-20 entries needed. Candidates identified in L-0090. Was about to start when response truncated.
2. **CLAUDE.md strip**: 468 lines → ~100-150. Content audit done (L-0094), decision logged. Not started.
3. **Old-format learnings conversion**: ~47 entries across design/general/performance/security files. Prompts 4/5 ready. Studio candidate.
4. **ONBOARDING.md stale references**: References file structure (failure-patterns.md etc.) that doesn't exist. References core.md that doesn't exist.
5. **index.md update**: Last updated Feb 26, now 56 entries behind.
6. **Memory slot compression**: 15/30 slots, optimization candidates identified (L-0095). Not urgent.

## Pending Decisions
- None requiring Brian's input right now. All decisions from this session are logged.

## Unpushed Commits
- None after final checkpoint push

## Active Priorities for Next Session
1. Push unpushed commits (Brian approves)
2. Create core.md (~15-20 curated entries from L-0042–L-0100)
3. Strip CLAUDE.md (468 → ~100-150 lines)
4. Fix ONBOARDING.md stale references
5. Old-format learnings conversion (Prompts 4/5, Studio)
6. Phase 1 prep (5 parallel agents, Mac Studio)

## Context the Next Session Needs
- Memory and repo are ONE system: memory triggers (always-injected), repo specifies (on-demand). L-0097.
- agent-operations.md is now 750+ lines with 59 entries. Hostile to onboard reading without core.md.
- Brian's lucidity for process work varies — when he's systematic, maximize capture. L-0096.
- Prompt stash protocol is active (memory #15). First action every response.
- CLAUDE.md root is correct location. stakd/ versions have battle-tested Next.js patterns. L-0094.

## Files Modified This Session
- .specs/learnings/agent-operations.md (primary — 56 new entries)
- ONBOARDING.md (checkpoint expansion)
- ACTIVE-CONSIDERATIONS.md (multiple reconciliations)
- DECISIONS.md (~10 new decisions)
- HOW-I-WORK-WITH-GENERATIVE-AI.md (~11 methodology signals)
- Agents.md (Round 40)
- .onboarding-state, .prompt-stash.json (protocol files)
- .specs/HANDOFF-PROTOCOL.md (new — handoff protocol)
