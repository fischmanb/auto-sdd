## 2026-02-28 — Learnings system: separate file per type (not monolithic catalog)

**Decision:** One file per learning type in `learnings/` at repo root.
**Why:** Grep works per-type without filtering. Files stay manageable size. New types = new file, not restructuring.
**Rejected:** Single monolithic catalog (scaling concern), directory-per-entry (overkill for markdown entries).

---

## 2026-02-28 — Learnings schema: flat K:V metadata (not YAML or compressed header)

**Decision:** Each entry uses `Key: value` on separate lines. One `Related:` line per relationship.
**Why:** Only format satisfying DESIGN-PRINCIPLES.md §1 (grepability without parsing). `grep "Type: failure_pattern"` just works.
**Rejected:** Alt A (pipe-delimited header) — saves 3 lines but breaks grep reliability. Alt B (YAML block) — requires jq/yq, violates "no nested structures requiring parsing."

---

## 2026-02-28 — Global sequential L-XXXX IDs (not per-type prefixes)

**Decision:** Single ID sequence shared across all learnings files.
**Why:** Type already in metadata — encoding in ID violates single-source-of-truth. Collision risk near zero with serial writes.
**Rejected:** Per-type prefixes (FP-0001, PR-0001) — redundant with Type field.

---

## 2026-02-28 — ISO 8601 datetime with timezone (not date-only)

**Decision:** `Date: 2026-02-28T20:31:00-05:00` format.
**Why:** Preserves intra-day ordering. Supports ET and future contributors. Grepability unaffected (prefix match works).
**Rejected:** Date-only (YYYY-MM-DD) — loses ordering within a day.

---

## 2026-03-01 — core.md is curated index (not filtered view)

**Decision:** Human judgment selects core entries. Chat proposes, Brian approves. No algorithmic criteria.
**Why:** "What must every fresh session know" is a judgment call, not a query.
**Rejected:** Automated filtering by confidence/status/tag — too mechanical, misses the point.

---

## 2026-03-01 — Deprecate .specs/learnings/agent-operations.md

**Decision:** Add deprecation pointer, preserve file, all new work goes to `learnings/`.
**Why:** 38 entries fully migrated. Single source of truth is now `learnings/`.
**Rejected:** Deletion — old prompts may still reference the path.

---

## 2026-03-01 — `checkpoint` as single context management command

**Decision:** One word ("checkpoint" in chat, `/checkpoint` in Claude Code) triggers a deterministic checklist that flushes captures, reconciles state, flags stale items, appends decisions, flags learnings, and commits.
**Why:** Context management files grew from 1 (ONBOARDING.md) to 5+ (state, active-considerations, decisions, learnings, index). Manual reconciliation is error-prone and inconsistent.
**Rejected:** Automated background sync (adds complexity, hides failures). Separate commands per file (cognitive overhead, easy to forget one).

---

## 2026-03-01 — Keep ONBOARDING.md as single file (don't split protocol or work log)

**Decision:** ACTIVE-CONSIDERATIONS.md split was worth it (frequent writes to small file). Further splits (protocol → CONTEXT-PROTOCOL.md, work log trim) are not — they add file proliferation without meaningful token or parseability gains for Claude.
**Why:** Fresh onboard reads everything anyway. Splits only help if the interval check path touches less data (ACTIVE-CONSIDERATIONS) or if Brian needs to scan less (already addressed by INDEX.md).
**Rejected:** CONTEXT-PROTOCOL.md (cosmetic), work log extraction (Agents.md already has it).

---

## 2026-03-01 — Rename post-campaign validation pipeline → "auto-QA"

**Decision:** Short name "auto-QA" for the post-campaign validation pipeline.
**Why:** The old name is unwieldy. The concept is autonomous post-build runtime repair.

---

## 2026-03-01 — Keep auto-QA and knowledge graph out of README

**Decision:** Don't publicize either in README until they have working implementations.
**Why:** Unproven concepts. README should reflect what works, not what's planned.

---

## 2026-03-01 — No static counts in README

**Decision:** Remove line counts, entry counts, and other volatile numbers from README.
**Why:** They go stale immediately. README should describe structure, not snapshot metrics.

---

## 2026-03-01 — Meta-document title: HOW-I-WORK-WITH-GENERATIVE-AI.md

**Decision:** Title the methodology document `HOW-I-WORK-WITH-GENERATIVE-AI.md`. Repo-agnostic content, lives at auto-sdd root.
**Why:** "Generative AI" scopes correctly without being too casual ("chatbots") or too narrow ("agents"). First-person framing is a feature given repo credibility. Considered `METHODOLOGY.md` (too generic) and `HOW-I-WORK-WITH-AI.md` (slightly less precise).

---

## 2026-03-01 — Bash→Python conversion identified as prerequisite for auto-QA

**Decision:** RICE analysis places bash→Python conversion (4.3) and auto-QA (3.2) as sequentially linked. Converting first makes auto-QA dramatically easier. Proposed sequence: fix stakd-v2 → convert to Python → implement auto-QA in Python.
**Why:** ~3,700 lines of bash orchestration hit a ceiling for implementing seven-phase runtime validation. Python offers real data structures, proper error handling, composability. Current bash works but blocks extensibility.
**Alternatives considered:** Implement auto-QA in bash first (proves concept before rewrite, avoids rewrite-before-shipping trap, but painful implementation). Deferred — decision not final, pending Brian's priority call.

---

## 2026-03-01 — Learnings voice: empirical for observations, absolutes for gates

**Decision:** Learnings entries that describe agent behavior use observed-voice ("have been observed to", "has proven unreliable"). Operational gates and safety constraints keep imperative voice ("must include STOP instructions", "every prompt must end with verification gates"). Voice guidance encoded in HOW-I-WORK-WITH-GENERATIVE-AI.md preamble and checkpoint.md step 5, NOT in DESIGN-PRINCIPLES.md.
**Why:** Brian doesn't like absolutes in meta-commentary — observations should be stated as observations. But weakening operational gates that protect against agent failures is dangerous. Scope matters.

---

## 2026-03-01 — stakd/ scripts are build artifacts, not conversion targets

**Decision:** `stakd/scripts/` and `stakd/lib/` are copies generated during campaigns, not a maintained codebase. Conversion targets only `auto-sdd/scripts/` and `auto-sdd/lib/`. stakd/ gets regenerated by whatever the build loop produces.
**Why:** Avoids converting two codebases. Scripts should be shared, not forked.

---

## 2026-03-01 — Libs-first conversion order

**Decision:** Convert the four libs (reliability, eval, codebase-summary, validation) before build-loop-local. Treat lib conversion as build-loop decomposition — extracting its guts into clean Python modules so the orchestrator conversion is just control flow.
**Why:** build-loop-local `source`s all four libs. Converting it first forces either ugly cross-language calls or one massive agent prompt. Libs first respects the dependency graph and keeps each agent prompt tight.

---

## 2026-03-01 — Keep file-based state during conversion, migrate later

**Decision:** Python conversion preserves existing file-based state formats. State migration (SQLite, structured JSON, etc.) is a separate project after Python conversion is stable.
**Why:** One variable at a time. Changing language AND state format simultaneously doubles debugging surface. Incremental migration also possible with shared file formats — can run half-bash half-Python during transition.

---

## 2026-03-01 — Convert small bash utilities to Python too

**Decision:** All bash converts to Python, including claude-wrapper, generate-mapping, nightly-review, setup-overnight, and uninstall-overnight. No bash remainders. Bundle small utilities into one agent prompt.
**Why:** One language, one test framework, one set of conventions. Eliminates split-language maintenance tax. launchd plist manipulation works fine via Python's `plistlib` + `subprocess`. Not worth preserving bash for any piece.

---

## 2026-03-01 — Conventions doc before any parallel agent work

**Decision:** Write a Python conventions document before launching any conversion agents. Specifies error handling, logging, config passing, state file format, import structure, naming. Every agent gets the same doc.
**Why:** Parallel lib conversion (4 agents) risks convention divergence — different exception patterns, logging approaches, config styles — that breaks integration in build-loop-local. Cheap to write, eliminates the sync problem.
