### Priority stack (updated 2026-02-28)

Ordered by efficiency gain per complexity added:

1. **stakd 28-feature campaign — v2 COMPLETE, v3 STALLED.**
   - **stakd-v2 (Sonnet 4.6)**: ✅ 28/28 features built. Post-campaign `npm run build` fails — client component (NewsCategoryFilter.tsx) transitively imports postgres via news.ts → db/index.ts. Same root cause as stakd-v1. Fix prompt drafted, pending execution.
   - **stakd-v3 (Haiku 4.5)**: ⏸️ Stalled at 11/28 features. Hung `claude` process (PID 94635) killed 2026-02-28. Build loop needs restart.
   - **Throughput finding**: Token speed does NOT translate to build speed. Haiku 2x faster tokens but only marginally faster builds (~16-18 min/feature both models) because npm install, TypeScript compile, tests, drift checks are fixed-cost CPU/disk-bound steps. Parallelism across features matters more than per-feature model speed.
   - **Build logs**: `stakd-v2/logs/build-*.log` and `stakd-v3/logs/build-*.log`.
   - Round 35 merged to main and pushed to origin.
   - **Data snapshot**: `~/auto-sdd/campaign-results/` — raw/ and reports/ per campaign variant.
2. **auto-QA (post-campaign validation pipeline)** — Multi-agent pipeline: boot app, Playwright browse, generate ACs from specs, test, catalog failures, RCA, fix through build gates. Seven phases (0-5, Phase 4 split into 4a+4b). Spec: `WIP/post-campaign-validation.md` (v0.3). *Spec complete, implementation not started.*
3. **Local model integration** — Replace cloud API with local LM Studio on Mac Studio. Reference: `archive/local-llm-pipeline/`. *Not started.*
4. **Adaptive routing / parallelism** — Only if data from 1–3 justifies complexity. *Deprioritized.*

### Historical build estimator (designed, not yet built)

Correlates t-shirt sizes with actual metrics from `logs/build-summary-*.json`. Writes to `logs/estimation-model.json`. Self-correcting after each `write_build_summary()`. Build after stakd campaign provides real data.

### Other active items

- **Learnings system — IMPLEMENTED (2026-03-01)**: Complete. 38 entries, 8 in core.md. Remaining: back-references not fully bidirectional.
- **Knowledge graph for workflow continuity (2026-02-28)**: Personal workflow tool for cross-session context. *Design phase — no implementation started.*
- **README update needed (2026-03-01)**: File map, schema/grep protocols, learnings system, checkpoint command. Do NOT include auto-QA or knowledge graph — unproven.
- **"How Brian works with Chatbots" meta-document (2026-03-01)**: Proposed. Scope TBD.
